#Code Explanation by Denigma
The code starts by importing the Google Speech Recognition library.
The code then creates a variable called sr which is of type speech_recognition.
The code then starts an infinite loop that listens to audio from the microphone and converts it into text with Google Speech Recognition.
If there are any errors, they will be printed out in a try-except block.
If there is no error, the generated text will be returned as output.
The code is an example of how to use Google Speech Recognition.
